# salsa

Write a program that lets a salsa maker track sales for five different types of salsa they produce: mild, medium, sweet, hot, and zesty. Use two parallel arrays with 5 elements in each: one is an array of strings for the salsa names, and the other is an array of integers for the number of jars sold for each salsa type. Create the string array with an initialization list. Prompt the user for the sales numbers for the second array. After all the data has been entered, produce a report that displays sales for each salsa type, total sales, and the names of the highest selling and lowest selling products.

Use 4 functions: one that gets the sales data and stores it in the sales array, one that finds the position in the sales array of the largest sales number, one that finds the position in the sales array of the smallest sales number, and one that displays the report which uses both arrays. 

Here is an example of the results:

Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for different sets of sales numbers. Create 3 test cases. Run your code, enter the data from each test case, and compare your results to those test cases. Take screenshots of all 3 results.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases, AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
